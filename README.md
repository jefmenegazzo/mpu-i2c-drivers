# MPU I2C Drivers

The MPU-9250, MPU-9150, MPU-6500, and MPU-6050 are 6-axis (MPU-6050) or 9-axis (MPU-9250, MPU-9150, MPU-6500) motion tracking devices that include a combination of accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer sensors. They are commonly used in embedded systems to provide accurate motion and orientation sensing for various applications such as drones, robotics, and virtual reality. The sensors use the I2C protocol for communication and provide high precision and low noise data for reliable performance.

This Github project is a collection of I2C driver libraries for the MPU-9250, MPU-9150, MPU-6500, and MPU-6050 sensors, written in various programming languages. The libraries allow for easy communication and reading of data from the sensors on embedded devices, such as microcontrollers.

The libraries are available in C, C++, C#, Python, Java and Javascript (Node.js), making them highly accessible to developers on different platforms and development environments. Each library includes functions to initialize the sensors, configure sampling rates, select measurement scales, calibrate the sensors, and read the raw data of motion and orientation.

# Roadmap

This project is currently under development, according to the following roadmap. Along with the source code libraries, wikis will also be created that provide comprehensive support documentation for configuring RPi, I2C, VNC, SSH, and other related topics.
